This is _my_ journey into learning Vue, and other stuff that I'll want to check out.

I think I'll probably write some sort of guide to what I'm doing, but there's no way of knowing this for certain at this point...

## Who am I
Hi My name is Peter, I'm a fullstack developer from Belgium. My daily stack is a Symfony backend, with a MariaDB database, Redis for cache and Elastic for search. A frontend using Angular and AngularJS.

I also manage the inhouse docker based development stack. And manage the linux servers that host our Atlassian apps etc.

## What is Vue
Vue.js is a popular JavaScript library. They pride themselves on being:

- **Approachable**:
  The only things you should know is how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- **Versatile**:
  By choosing how you wish to implement it, you could either use it as a library, or as a full-featured framework.
- **Performant**:
  Stats found on the vue website claim:
  - 20KB min+gzip Runtime
  - Blazing Fast Virtual DOM
  - Minimal Optimization Efforts

## Why should you care
Couple of things come to mind…

- First and foremost, Vue is an immensely popular library on github. It has 110,225 stars as of now, compared to React (108,311),AngularJS (58,890) or Angular (39,310), it is simply the most popular of the popular frameworks / libraries according to github stars.
  It isn’t however the most “watched” or the most “forked” distro. But still, it is very popular.
- Secondly, jobs. The number of comapnies looking for vue-professionals is on the rise, as it has been for a while now. I don’t see any reason why this would stop anytime soon.
- Thirdly, because a a front-end developer you need to constantly learn the newer things. My career isn’t very long. I think I’m now in my 8th year since moving out of school.
  When I graduated, I was a Flash-professional, AS3 was my weapon of choice. I’ve since used (for frontend) Enyo, AngularJS, Angular and React…
- Lastly, it _could_ be fun, right?

## What will I make
I want to create a chat application. This can start out with a very simple backend, that registers new users and simply transmits messages.

This is good since I called this repo **Learn Vue With Me**. The application should be heavier on the frontend.

The good thing about creating a simple chat application, is that it keeps options to new series and new technologies open. For instance, as it stands now, the backend will be written with node.js, but maybe once the frontend heavy series is done, I might start a new repo as a fork, and title it as: "_Learn GO With Me_", and perhaps I can follow it up with: "_Learn Encryption With Me_"...

## Will you ever do those things?
Who knows...
